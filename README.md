redtheme, my personal vscode theme under construction.

I add tokens as I encounter them so it's still under construction and will be for the foreseeable future.

Does not support VSCode bracket pair colorization and
a bunch of other features.

Supports:

- Javascript
- Typescript
- JSX
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown
